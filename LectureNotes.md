## Game

### Why making mistakes is important.

I have a rule in mind. You have to figure out what my rule is. I can't tell you what my rule is. I can tell you that the following three numbers follow my rule: 2, 4, 8. You can propose any three numbers of your own and I can tell you if they follow my rule. Can you work out what my rule is? I can't tell you if you are correct.

## SMART learning goals

SMART is an acronym to remember some rules for setting good goals:

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Relevant
* Timed

## Example Learning Plan

Here's an example learning plan. You can use this as a template or make your own:

### Goal

In two hours I want to be able to move a player character around in a Unity project under keyboard control.

### Plan

I have followed some programming tutorials in Unity before, but I don't know how to make player input move objects around in a Unity scene.

#### Resources

I will follow this tutorial: URL it takes about 10 minutes. I will also refer to the sections of the Unity scripting manual regarding movement and input:

http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.html

## Exercise

Make a learning plan.
1. Write down your goal
2. Write down how you intend to achieve it
3. Follow your plan.

Write a SMART goal for yourself. Get another student to check that your goal is SMART.
