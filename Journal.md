# Learning journal example

### 29/9/2015

Tripped up by language. Variable called 'introduced' meaning "I introduced myself" but latter used as "object was introduced this frame." In the first sense the variable starts false and then turns true. In the second it starts true and then turns false. Good blog post material. (Use as an example of a work journal / learning journal entry.)
